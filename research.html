              <span class="custom_bold">The 21st century is fundamentally different from any other point
              in human history. We have achieved unprecedented technological
              advances and global connectivity. However, these achievements have
              also given rise to challenges that gravely threaten our future.
              <p>Environmental changes resulting from our activities are increasing
              the pace of species and habitat loss, impacting our global economy
              and ecosystem services we rely on. Forecasted environmental
              changes will also accelerate the emergence of novel
              human-infecting pathogens with pandemic potential. <p>Consequently,
              it has become clear that the health and future of our species is
              intimately linked with the health and future of the planet’s
              biodiversity and environments.

              Although
              evolutionary biology has classically been regarded as a historical
              science, my work has underscored its importance for such developing innovative
              research programs that can be deployed at the intersection between
              humanity, the world’s biota, and our shared ecosystems.
              Incorporating tools and techniques from evolutionary biology into
              informatics and -omics approaches allow me to not only learn of
              the history of life, but also from it. This evolutionary
              informatic approach can leverage the power of increasingly massive
              biological and -omic data and positions me to achieve </span><span class="strong" ; style="color: rgb(47, 156, 202)"

            <h3>Our Role</h3>
            <p>
              My research is derived from a core foundation in phylogenomics,
              macroevolution, and immunogenetics. By maintaining these strong core research areas, I am able to
              leverage my research and computational experience into novel
              evolutionary informatic analyses for multi/interdisciplinary
              projects. For example, my pioneering integration of evolutionary
              and immunological data remains uniquely informative regarding the
              immunology of SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis. This example illustrates how
              my core foundational strengths allow me to develop evolutionary informatic applications
              with high contemporary relevance for human health.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my research program I emphasize the study of ray-finned fishes
              (Actinopterygians). Actinopterygians comprise one out of every two
              vertebrates and include numerous species of ecological, economic,
              and research importance. I routinely conduct short-term research
              projects aimed at filling critical knowledge gaps in our
              understanding of these diverse organisms. My long-term research
              projects build upon these insights to
            </p>

            <p>
              <li>
                provide a historical foundation for forecasting the response of
                species facing global changes
              </li>
              <li>illuminate general rules of evolutionary persistence</li>
              <li>
                develop a comparative perspective on the roles of genotypic
                novelty and variability in shaping the molecular pathways that
                underlie the vertebrate immune response.
              </li>
            </p>
            <p>
              Collectively, these findings can provide necessary historical
              context that facilitates accurate projection of the resilience of
              biodiversity over the next century.
