My research program takes an integrative approach to explore the factors that underlie the origin and maintenance of vertebrate biodiversity, with an emphasis on the study of ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygiians). Actinopterygiians comprise over half of all living vertebrate species—a better understanding of their history will shed light onto long standing questions in evolutionary biology that have relevance to both conservation and human health such as: how do lineages persist and recover from rapid environmental change? How do we extract relevant information from genome-scale datasets to efficiently link genotypes to phenotypes? What are the mechanisms and functional consequences of vertebrate immune gene evolution?  To address these types of questions, I often cross traditional research boundaries, enabling the integration of perspectives from the fields of biodiversity science,  molecular phylogenomics, functional and computational genomics, and human health. This integrative approach to research not provides a historical foundation for forecasting the response of species facing global changes while illuminating general features of vertebrate evolution, but also is critical for developing a comparative perspective of the molecular pathways vertebrates have taken to distinguish normal cells from pathogens.

I am a M.Sc. student in the Department of Applied Ecology at North Carolina State University, where I work on invasive carp (Cyprinus carpio) in a shallow lake ecosystem. In general, I am interested in the ecology, physiology, and diversity of marine and freshwater fishes. Here at the museum I have been involved in a number of projects including: (1) <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318660129_Cradles_and_museums_of_Antarctic_teleost_biodiversity?_iepl%5BviewId%5D=7VrdiZEkOGNKwKZwBr2HhzOe&_iepl%5BprofilePublicationItemVariant%5D=default&_iepl%5Bcontexts%5D%5B0%5D=prfpi&_iepl%5BtargetEntityId%5D=PB%3A318660129&_iepl%5BinteractionType%5D=publicationTitle"> examining the diversification dynamics of Antarctic fishes</a>, (2) <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308891841_Disentangling_the_Influence_of_Urbanization_and_Invasion_on_Endemic_Geckos_in_Tropical_Biodiversity_Hot_Spots_A_Case_Study_of_Phyllodactylus_martini_Squamata_Phyllodactylidae_along_an_Urban_Gradient_i">investigating how urbanization impacts</a> the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316107244_Endolymphatic_Sac_Use_and_Reproductive_Activity_in_the_Lesser_Antilles_Endemic_Gecko_Gonatodes_antillensis_Gekkota_Sphaerodactylidae">natural history </a> of geckos native to Curaçao, and currently (3) examining morphological and ecological diversity in reef fishes. In addition to this, I assist with maintaining and databasing collection specimens.

<br>
After retiring as a statistician working on problems in public health and medical applications, I wondered what to do with my free time. Then I became fascinated by ideas about the underlying processes and consequences of evolution. And so, I return to earlier interests in life with new tools and perspectives. My goal is to contribute in any way I can to ongoing studies in the lab.

<br>
I am a born naturalist with a B.S. in Marine Science and minor in Plant Biology from NC State University. My love for the natural world began early. A childhood snorkeling off Grand Cayman introduced me to the world below the waves and I went on to become involved with study abroad research in the Bahamas, animal husbandry through The Maritime Aquarium and marine biology education with the Sea Turtle Camp. These experiences fueled my passion for marine science. Since working at the Fish Lab, I have become interested in both the adaptive radiation of Antarctic icefish and patterns of morphological evolution in trigger and filefishes. When I am not working at the research station, I enjoys orchid keeping, SCUBA diving and merging my passions for science and fine art in the form of detailed biological illustrations. I aspire to attend graduate school and inspire others to develop their own passion for marine life.

<br>
I graduated from Emory University in 2014 with a bachelors in Environmental Science and a minor in math. My primary interest lies in marine conservation and I have worked in several areas of marine science education and outreach, fisheries management policy analysis, and field and lab based marine research. Working with the fishes unit I am developing a foundation in phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses as we investigate a complex pattern of cryptic species diversity in Caribbean blennies. Understanding patterns of species diversity forms the critical foundation for much of organismal biology, and I look forward to utilizing the skills and knowledge I gain in the ichthyology unit to develop new perspectives on contemporary issues in marine conservation.

<br>
I am currently getting my feet wet in phylogenetic studies by constructing a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycopodiophyta'> Lycopod</a> Tree of Life and also studying the possible effects of Madagascar's hypervariable climate on the community-level organization its endemic trees. I'm interested in pursuing projects in plant phylogenetics that unite integrative taxonomy, herbarium research, and applications towards conservation. What can the history of flora found in our natural history collections tell us about impending (or active) changes in the floral landscape due to factors like climate change? What other novel uses arise for collections such as herbaria when a researcher combines modern data analysis with such historical datasets? What new strategies and biological understandings can combined molecular and morphological phylogenetic analyses give us by illuminating more branches (or new pathways) on the evolutionary trees of various plant groups?

<br>
I am a 2014 graduate of the University of North Carolina Wilmington with my B.S. in marine biology. My primary interests are in marine life and conservation and I enjoy both field work and hands on data gathering. I am currently collecting morphometric data to better understand biodiversity patterns in several species of fish, both in fresh and salt water. Quantifying morphological change within or between species can gleam valuable insights into a range of topics including the discovery of cryptic diversity and correlations between form,  function, and life history. I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge of fishes and ultimately finding a career in this field of study.

<br>
I hold degrees in Zoology from NC State University, a Masters in Coastal Environmental Management from Duke University, and a degree in Veterinary Medical Technology.  I love championing less celebrated species, especially those that have a profound influence on our natural ecosystems. Fishes are one such example, often seen only through a consumer lens. I seek to reveal the extraordinary and diverse characteristics of these taxa, and bring awareness to their plight for a more sustainable existence alongside humanity. Working in the fishes unit, I am involved in a study assessing the evolutionary dynamics associated with transitions between activity patterns, and am helping the unit develop a research program in fish hematology in collaboration with the museum's veterinary staff. I also have a guinea pig named Hubble, named after the telescope that has arguably provided data for the most groundbreaking scientific discoveries in the history of humankind, and a puppy named Simba.He is fluffy and goofy, and has been taught to be wary of estranged uncles bearing gifts.
