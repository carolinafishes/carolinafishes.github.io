<h4>Alex Dornburg, Ph.D.</h4>

<p>In my lab group, we aim to develop a better understanding of the general principles 
that have given rise to the diversity of living vertebrates and enabled their persistence. This 
knowledge not only allows us to gain a better understanding of the evolution of our own genomes, 
but also provides critical historical context for emergent challenges to both human health and conservation.</p>

We are currently focusing on three core research topics
1) The factors that shaped marine fish biodiversity; with an emphasis on the mechanisms and functional 
consequences of gene family diversification in the innate immune system
2) Leveraging the power of phylogenomic comparative methods to better understand critical aspects of 
SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 biology such as the durability of immunity following infections and the genetic 
mechanisms that enable zoonosis
3) The development of theory and software to aid comparative phylogenomic research

These topics work towards a goal of illuminating general rules of vertebrate evolution. In turn, 
this understanding can be applied to facilitate more effective stewardship of our planet, inform public
 health decision making, and establish a foundation for predicting the association of gene clusters with 
 human health phenotypes.

<h4>Katerina Zapfe, M.Sc.</h4>
<i>Graduate Researcher</i>

<p>I'm Kat, a SCUBA diver, NSF Graduate Research Fellow, and PhD student in the Dornburg lab interested in the evolution and conservation of marine biodiversity. I ask how morphology, ecology, or presence of specific genes can influence the evolution of fishes across spaceand time. My thesis research uses an interdisciplinary approach to explore how marine fishes respond to  extreme habitat transitions at inter-individual and macroevolutionary scales. Through phylogenomics, models and comparative 
methods, I ask how environmental changes happening today can impact the fish diversity of tomorrow.</p>

<h4>Rittika Malik</h4>
<i>Principal Investigator</i>

     alt="Image of Rittika Malik" />          
<p>I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Bioinformatics department at UNC Charlotte.  I have completed my Masters from the same
department where I worked on population genetics. I am interested in evolutionary biology and studying the diversity of animals
all across the globe. I am currently studying the evolution of immune genes in fishes. I am interested in understanding the repertoire
of innate immune receptors in the early divergence of ray finned fishes. Recently I’ve been interested in signal regulatory proteins
which are part of the immune system in our body. These are genes which bind to cancer cells and give off a “Don't eat me” signal to
the immune system. Studying this is significant because it helps to understand how evolution affects cancer development. In the future,
I’d like to look more into the evolution of cancer in other animals for learning human cancers. I am also working on genome announcement
of Polypterus bichir and Long nosed gar. My skills involve developing pipelines for immunogenetics research by using a combination of
python, R, and bash. I am familiar with libraries such as BWA, openmpi, Busco, RepdeNovo and other bioinformatics pipelines. During my
free time, I love swimming, photography and travelling to new places.</p>

<h4>Cameron Nguyen</h4>
<i>Graduate Researcher</i>
<br>
<p>I'm Cameron Nguyen, a masters student at UNC Charlotte pursuing a graduate degree in Bioinformatics. I obtained my bachelors degree
from NCSU and am now soon to graduate from UNCC. My interests have always included computers, so naturally I gravitated towards
the bioinformatics program at UNCC. Being of a biological science background, it felt like the perfect arrangement to combine
the two. My current research involves an investigation regarding the evolution of innate immune system genes.</p>

<p>I'm Alexandra, a graduate student in the Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics at UNCC with a particular interest in studying
the impacts of endosymbiosis on the genome of marine organisms. </p>

<h4>Manav Rohilla</h4>
<i>Undergraduate Researcher</i>
<br>

     alt="Image of Manav Rohilla" alt="">
<p>Hello! My name is Manav (it might take a couple tries to get it right)! I am a junior at UNC Charlotte and am studying Computer Science
with concentration in bioinformatics. I’ve been interested in how life on this planet has evolved with time since high school, and
bioinformatics is, in my opinion, one of the most interesting ways to analyze the evolutionary history that can be found within the
biosphere we inhabit. The work I do in the Evolutionary Informatics Lab (conveniently shortened to EvIL) revolves mostly around the
acquisition, analysis, and reorganization of genetic data associated with viruses. Outside of EvIL, I enjoy aviation, playing guitar,
playing video games, and drinking what some may consider to be copious amounts of coffee!</p>

<h3>April Lamb, M.Sc.</h3>
<i> Research Technician </i>

     alt="Image of April Lamb">
<p>I'm April, a Research Technician in the Dornburg Lab. Prior to this position, I received my Masters degree in Biology, Ecology and 
Evolution and a professional certificate in Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) from North Carolina
State University. I am also a 2017 National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow and hold a Bachelor's degree in Zoology
from NC State. Broadly, I am interested in better understanding the bases of ecosystem resiliency (i.e. what factors contribute
to an ecosystem's ability to recover from perturbations) and applying this knowledge to inform science-based policy and management
decisions. I am especially interested in systems that are experiencing high levels of anthropogenically-driven change.</p>
