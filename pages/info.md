With over 30,000 species, ray-finned fishes are argueably among the most successful vertebrates on our planet. And, although they may look quite different from us, we share remarkable genetic similarities with species as diverse as gar and pufferfishes. But just how did this diversity come to be, and how has it persisted over millions of years? Moreover, how can an understanding of this diversity aid us in undersdtanding our own genomes? Our group investigates the biodiversity of fishes to answer these types of questions. 

## Our lab focuses on

* Phylogenetic investigations to contexualize global change
* Providing evolutionary insights into human health problems
* Empowering cost effective research through the development of theory and software 


## Keeping up with what we do

This site is designed to give you a behind the scenes look at what we are doing and discoveries we are sharing with the scientific community. You can keep up with our [news highlights here][1] and check out our [software for biologists][2] or [publications][3]. We also have several other [blogs][3] you can browse to see where we are or what we are working on. 

This site wouldn't be possible without [GitHub][6] who have created a great environment for sharing and cooperation among scientists worldwide, and [phlow][5] who provided much of foundation for this site's architecture.

We hope you enjoy the site. 

Yours sincerely, [The Dornburg Lab][7]
