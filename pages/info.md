With over 30,000 species, ray-finned fishes are argueably among the most successful animals on our planet. But just how did this diversity come to be, and how has it persisted over millions of years? Our team investigates the biodiversity of fishes and also helps scientists around the world do so by maintaining a collection of over 1 million research specimens from across the globe. 

## Our lab focuses on

* Phylogenetic investigations to contexualize global change
* Providing evolutionary insights into human health problems
* Empowering cost effective research through the development of theory and software 



## The collection we maintain includes

* Tissue samples for genomic analyses
* Specimens of freshwater fishes from drainages across the US
* Representation from over 42 countries
* An extensive osteological collection
* The main repository of Southeastern US fishes
* A large collection of rare larval deep-sea fishes
* Research ready locality data, georeferenced with coordinate uncertainty



## Keeping up with what we do

Much of what our lab does happens behind the scenes of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. This site is designed to give you a behind the scenes look at what we are doing and discoveries we are sharing with the scientific community. You can keep up with our [collection news here][1] and check out our [software for biologists][2] or [publications][3]. We also have several other [blogs][3] you can browse to see where we are or what we are working on. 

This site wouldn't be possible without [GitHub][4] who have created a great environment for sharing and cooperation among scientists worldwide, and [phlow][5] who provided much of foundation for this site's architecture.

We hope you enjoy the site. 

Yours sincerely, [The Dornburg Lab][7]
