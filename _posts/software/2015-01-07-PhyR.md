We introduce PhyR, an open source software package that facilitates rapid calculation of phylogenetic informativeness and several novel related assessments of the phylogenetic utility of any given dataset or dataset partition. By facilitating computation on user hardware, PhyR increases the potential power users can apply toward screening datasets for phylogenetic information content by orders of magnitude. PhyR also features expanded functionality compared to current resources, providing new tools for data visualization and routines optimized for rapid statistical calculations using parallel processing.

<br>
<a href='https://github.com/carolinafishes/PhyR'> PhyR can be downloaded here and requires R and python for full functionality.</a> 
<br>
<br> Although cross-platform, PhyR makes uses of numpy, scipy, and sympy in python. These can be easily installed using <a href='https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/'>Anaconda</a> on any platform. 
<br> A walthrough of PhyR is available <a href='http://carolinafishes.github.io/software/PhyR_manual'>here</a>
