One of my students, Katerina Zapfe, and I recently designed a three part exhibit on sharks to use during outreach events. When you are designing interactive content using specimens it is never really clear what the reception will be like until the event. In this case, the reception was incredible.

Get into the ocean deeper than your waist with a group of people and almost certainly someone will start talking about sharks. However, do sharks really deserve their fearsome reputation? </em>

<h3> Looking beyond the teeth </h3>

<img class="b30" src="http://carolinafishes.github.io/images/shark9.jpg" alt=""><em>Over the course of about two hours, our unit's students, technicians, and volunteers took over 150 people through a series of interactive games to learn about shark biology, shark diversity, the efforts of my student, Tim Curtis, to develop a platform for citizen science projects with sharks, and how sharks are creating incredible new breakthroughs in human medicine.  </em>

The exhibit was packed and it was great seeing how positive everyone was about sharks</em>

Prior to the start of the film, I also had the opportunity to speak about sharks and my own experiences with the film jaws. Following the film we also did jaws trivia with prizes and had audience members ask me random questions about sharks. It was an incredible evening and everyone who attended was wonderful. Hopefully we will be participating in many more movie night events in the future!
