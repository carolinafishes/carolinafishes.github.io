I recently coauthored a piece for the Naturalist Magazine with Meg Eberle about our oldest specimen and thought I would post some of the article here.
<br>

Since its inception in the late nineteenth century, the Museum has worked to collect and study fishes from North Carolina, and has since grown to archive specimens from around the entire world. In addition to being of tremendous scientific value, these specimens occasionally serve as intriguing vignettes of our unique maritime history. A perfect example is the oldest specimen in the collection: A swordfish (Xiphias gladius) bill dating back to 1869, on which a rather worn looking label indicates that the swordfish was “Brot [sic] into NEW BEDFORD, MASS. On a ‘Whaler’ about 1869.”
<br>

Whaling was once a thriving part of the US economy, and New Bedford was at the epicenter of this industry. Whale parts were used for a variety of everyday products, ranging from oils and soaps to corsets, umbrellas, and skirts. However, whales are not a limitless resource and by 1869, ships were leaving New England and circumnavigating the globe in search of more. Meaning this swordfish bill specimen could have come from any part of the species’ extensive range.

Check out this animated video that reconstructs the routes of whaling vessels over time. By 1869 journeys out of New Bedford were nothing short of monumental.

So what does a swordfish have to do with whaling? 
<br>

Swordfish are large, predatory fish found throughout the temperate parts of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. These fish spend their days in very deep water and come to the surface at night, using their bills to swipe and slash at their favorite prey: smaller pelagic fish and squid. One of the fastest animals in the ocean, the hydrodynamic swordfish is an agile and adept hunter, which makes harpooning one by moonlight very unlikely. 
<br>

However, swordfish have a major weakness. Sometimes, they come to the surface by day to bask in the sun. This makes them an easy target for an opportunistic hunter with a harpoon. We'll never now if this specimen was shot from a whaleboat on one of it's long voyages or if it was shot from one of the many vessels harvesting these fishes from the Northern Atlantic.

Swordfishing harpooning in the 1800's used remarkably similar gear to whaling. Today, some fishermen continue to use harpoons to harvest swordfish. In fact, the marine stewardship council has certified the Nova Scotia fishery as sustainable, citing highly selective low impact fishing
