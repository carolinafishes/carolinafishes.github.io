<h3>Internship overview</h3>
<br>


Internships in our unit are part of <a href='http://naturalsciences.org/support/internships'> N.C. Museum of Natural Sciences Internship program</a> and designed to bridge the gap between college classroom experiences and professional work settings for a variety of careers in the biological sciences. We view interships as a way to provide training in new skills while facilitating the growth of collaborative networks and experience working with our research team and collaborators from around the world.
