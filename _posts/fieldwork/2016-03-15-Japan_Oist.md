I teamed up with Evan Economo, <a href='https://danlwarren.wordpress.com/'>Dan Warren </a> and <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Teresa_Iglesias'>Teresa Iglesias </a> at the <a href='https://www.oist.jp/'> Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology </a> to aid them on a quest to map the brain of teleost fishes. Our goal is to use special dyes and preservation techniques to CT-scan different regions of the brain in order to investigate the evolutionary dynamics that have given rise to the spectacular diversity of brain forms found in fish.

<h3> Scanning fish brains in Japan </h3>
<br> Working at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology is nothing short of amazing. Several buildings linked by sky bridges filled with some of the brightest minds armed with some of the most advanced technology in the world. Having the opportunity to work here was incredible.

CT-scanning fish brains is not trivial. Luckily Dan and Teresa were able to come up with the correct range of settings and innovative solutions to keeping the brains in the scanner without them moving. As you may imagine, no one has produced fish head holders for these machines yet. However, with some glue and a few hacks to common lab supplies we were able to make holders that kept heads from sliding.

Now that we are getting scans, stay tuned to hear about what we discover!
