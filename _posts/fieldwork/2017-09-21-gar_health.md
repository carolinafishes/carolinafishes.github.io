Over the past year we have been working with <a href='http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jayoder/'> Dr. Jeff Yoder </a> at the NC State Veterinary School on several projects that focus on the genetics of immune function in gar and bowfin. 
<h3>Why these fishes?</h3>
<br> 
We share 70 percent of our genes with fish, and advances in genetic engineering allow us to test how these genes contribute to everything from behavior to disease. While several fish species are already used as model systems, all contain a duplicated genome. This genome duplication is a major problem that makes relating genetic mechanisms between humans and fish especially difficult. Consequently, this raises the challenge of identifying species that bridge the genetic gap between model fish and humans. Fortunately, a group of fishes that reside in the waters of North America may well be the missing link – gar.

<br>
<br>
Referred to by Darwin as living fossils, gar are members of an ancient fish lineage that do not possess a duplicated genome. Instead gar contain a mix of genes that sometimes more closely resemble those in humans rather than fish. This amazing similarity can be utilized when we develop a better understanding of how gar genomes evolved, which will be critical in linking the genes of fish to humans.
<br>
We currently are funded through the triangle center for evolutionary medicine <a href='http://tricem.dreamhosters.com/'> (TriCEM) </a> to investigate genes relevant to human immune function also shared by gar species, with the goal of effectively translating genetic research in model fish to human health and disease.

<br>
This week, we went out with our collaborator Michael Fisk at the NC Wildlife Resource Commission to collect some additional blood samples from a gar and bowfin (another ancient fish) on the Cape Fear River to further advance our studies this fall.

<br>
<br>
We were also joined by <a href='https://cvm.ncsu.edu/directory/passingham-ronald/Kent Passingham'> Kent Passingham </a> who was simultaneously collecting critical baseline data with which to conduct a health assessment of these fishes. Despite the promise of these fishes for medical research, no data exists on what healthy blood values look like for these ancient fishes.
<br>

We use a sampling technique that sends a small amount of electricity into the water and temporarily stuns fish, bringing them to the surface. The fish are stunned for a few seconds, just long enough to net and place into the livewell. This is a very effective and non-destructive sampling technique routinely used by agencies to monitor fish populations</em>
<br>
<br>
It was suprisingly difficult to find gar on this stretch of the Cape Fear. After nearly 4 hours we had only found a single fish despite virtually nonstop effort. Furtunately, our luck was about to change. By midafternoon we were able to catch a decent sample size of fishes from which we could assess vital blood based health statistics. These values represent the first bloodwork values in this species and will form the foundation for a more intensive health assessment in different habitats.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue our journey to link fish models to human health and monitor the health of these species in our waterways.
