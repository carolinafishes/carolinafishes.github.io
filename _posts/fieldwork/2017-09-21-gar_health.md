Over the past year we have been working with <a href='http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jayoder/'> Dr. Jeff Yoder </a> at the NC State Veterinary School on several projects that focus on the genetics of immune function in gar and bowfin. 
<h3>Why these fishes?</h3>
<br> 
It turns out that these fishes diverged from 99% of all other fishes nearly 350 million years ago. With these deep divergences, many aspects of their genetics more closely resemble birds and mammals than other fishes. In fact, gar and bowfin have a very conserved genomes that allow us to link genes in model fish organisms like zebrafish back to humans. 
<br>
We currently are funded through the triangle center for evolutionary medicine <a href='http://tricem.dreamhosters.com/'> (TriCEM) </a> for this work and have been conducting several DNA based studies. However, knowing what immune genes are in gar does not reveal their function.

This week, we went out with our collaborator Michael Fisk at the NC Wildlife Resource Commission to collect blood samples from a few gar and bowfin (another ancient fish) on the Cape Fear River.

We were also joined by <a href='https://cvm.ncsu.edu/directory/passingham-ronald/Kent Passingham'> Kent Passingham </a> who was simultaneously collecting critical baseline data with which to conduct a health assessment of these fishes. Despite the promise of these fishes for medical research, no data exists on what healthy blood values look like for these ancient fishes.

It was suprisingly difficult to find gar on this stretch of the Cape Fear. After nearly 4 hours we had only found a single fish despite virtually nonstop effort. Furtunately, our luck was about to change. By midafternoon we were able to catch a decent sample size of fishes from which we could assess vital blood based health statistics. These values represent the first bloodwork values in this species and will form the foundation for a more intensive health assessment in different habitats.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue our journey to link fish models to human health and monitor the health of these species in our waterways!
