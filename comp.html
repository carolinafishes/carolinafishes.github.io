										<h3>Making the connection</h3>
										<p>Ecological and evolutionary principles are central elements in organismal health. An understanding of ecology and evolution can greatly improve our ability to face some of the largest threats to human health including as antibiotic resistance, zoonotic transmission, or cancer. Our lab strives to leverage its phylogenomic expertise to aid in this endeavour </p>
										<p>We collaborate closely with other groups and have worked on topics that include the evolution of key oncogenes, the response of cancer to specific treatment, and most recently on the durability of the immune response following infection by SARS-CoV-2 </p>
										<h3>Using evolution to determine SARS-CoV-2 reinfection risks</h3>
										<p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, there was much uncertainty about how long immunity lasts after someone who is unvaccinated is infected with SARS-CoV-2. Working together with <a href="#">Dr. Jeffrey Townsend</a> at the Yale School of Public Health and several other collaborators, we developed an innovative approach rooted in phylogenetic comparative methods to provide an answer: strong protection following natural infection is short-lived. </p>
										<p>We analyzed known reinfection and immunological data from the close viral relatives of SARS-CoV-2 that cause “common colds” — along with immunological data from SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Leveraging evolutionary principles, the team was able to model the risk of COVID-19 reinfection over time.
										Reinfections can and have happened, even shortly after recovery. And they will become increasingly common as immunity wanes and new SARS-CoV-2 variants arise.</p>
										<p>This model and findings were published long before reinfections were common or data on reinfection was available and have proven to be highly accurate<p>
										<h3>What about vaccination?</h3>
										<p>We have expanded our model to assess the risk of future infection by SARS-CoV-2 over time following vaccination from several vaccines. This provides a comparative basis for natural and vaccine mediated immunity as well as quantitative evidence that supports current booster schedules. </p>
										<h3>Lab initiatives</h3>

											<h3>Projecting the seasonality of endemic COVID-19</h3>
											<p>It is clear that COVID-19 will become an endemic disease. However, when to expect surges of cases in different parts of the world is less clear. </p><p>On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 could follow a pattern similar to other seasonal respiratory viruses such as the flu. On the other hand, it is possible the low levels of circulation occur year round. This would be similar to several other non-seasonal respiratory viruses</p><p> Using incidence data from across the Northern Hemisphere the closest evolutionary relatives of SARS-CoV-2, we projected what an endemic COVID-19 might look like and just published a preprint </p>
