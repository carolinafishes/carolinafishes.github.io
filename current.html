		 							<b>Katerina Zapfe</b><br>
		 							<i> PhD Student</i><br>
										I'm Kat, a SCUBA diver, NSF Graduate Research Fellow, and PhD student in the Dornburg lab interested in the evolution and conservation
										of marine biodiversity. I ask how morphology, ecology, or presence of specific genes can influence the evolution of fishes across space
										and time. My thesis research uses an interdisciplinary approach to explore how marine fishes respond to extreme habitat transitions at
										inter-individual and macroevolutionary scales. Through phylogenomics, models and comparative methods, I ask how environmental changes
										happening today can impact the fish diversity of tomorrow.

									<b>Rittika Malik</b><br>
									<i> PhD Student</i><br>
										I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Bioinformatics department at UNC Charlotte.  I have completed my Masters from the same
										department where I worked on population genetics. I am interested in evolutionary biology and studying the diversity of animals
										all across the globe. I am currently studying the evolution of immune genes in fishes. I am interested in understanding the repertoire
										of innate immune receptors in the early divergence of ray finned fishes. Recently I’ve been interested in signal regulatory proteins
										which are part of the immune system in our body. These are genes which bind to cancer cells and give off a “Don't eat me” signal to
										the immune system. Studying this is significant because it helps to understand how evolution affects cancer development. In the future,
										I’d like to look more into the evolution of cancer in other animals for learning human cancers. I am also working on genome announcement
										of Polypterus bichir and Long nosed gar. My skills involve developing pipelines for immunogenetics research by using a combination of
										python, R, and bash. I am familiar with libraries such as BWA, openmpi, Busco, RepdeNovo and other bioinformatics pipelines. During my
										free time, I love swimming, photography and travelling to new places.

									<b>Cameron Nguyen</b><br>
									<i> Masters Student</i><br>
										I'm Cameron Nguyen, a masters student at UNC Charlotte pursuing a graduate degree in Bioinformatics. I obtained my bachelors degree
										from NCSU and am now soon to graduate from UNCC. My interests have always included computers, so naturally I gravitated towards
										the bioinformatics program at UNCC. Being of a biological science background, it felt like the perfect arrangement to combine
										the two. My current research involves an investigation regarding the evolution of innate immune system genes.

									<b>Alexandra Tew</b><br>
									<i> Masters Student</i><br>
										I'm Alexandra, a graduate student in thr Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics at UNCC with a particular interest in studying
										the impacts of endosymbiosis on the genome of marine organisms. I am currently working on the evolution of gene families in nototheniod fishes, with a focus on the relationship between changes in opsin gene tuning sites and habitat.

									<b>Manav Rohilla</b><br>
									<i> Undergraduate, Sophomore</i><br>
										Hello! My name is Manav (it might take a couple tries to get it right)! I am a junior at UNC Charlotte and am studying Computer Science
										with concentration in bioinformatics. I’ve been interested in how life on this planet has evolved with time since high school, and
										bioinformatics is, in my opinion, one of the most interesting ways to analyze the evolutionary history that can be found within the
										biosphere we inhabit. The work I do in the Evolutionary Informatics Lab (conveniently shortened to EvIL) revolves mostly around the
										acquisition, analysis, and reorganization of genetic data associated with viruses. Outside of EvIL, I enjoy aviation, playing guitar,
										playing video games, and drinking what some may consider to be copious amounts of coffee!

									<b>Ella Kellner</b><br>
									<i>Undergraduate, Freshman</i><br>
										I'm Ella, a freshman at UNC Charlotte. I am majoring in Biology and have a great interest in environmental and evolutionary sciences. I aim to have a career in research and I am working to gain the research experience that I will need in the future. I am currently focusing my efforts helping in the Dornburg laboratory.

									<b>April Lamb</b><br>
									<i>Research Technician</i><br>
										I'm April, a Research Technician in the Dornburg Lab. Prior to this position, I received my Masters degree in Biology, Ecology and Evolution and a professional certificate in Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) from North Carolina State University. I am also a 2017 National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow and hold a Bachelor's degree in Zoology from NC State. Broadly, I am interested in better understanding the bases of ecosystem resiliency (i.e. what factors contribute to an ecosystem's ability to recover from perturbations) and applying this knowledge to inform science-based policy and management decisions. I am especially interested in systems that are experiencing high levels of anthropogenically-driven change.
